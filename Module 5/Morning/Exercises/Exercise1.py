"""
Exercise 1: In this exercise, you are to encrypt and decrypt a message using RSA in the Cryptography library. Start by downloading todayâ€™s RSA live-coding example from GitHub.

(a): Run the code which generates RSA keys and saves them in separate PEM files. You should now have two PEM files, one for the private key and one for the public key. Use the parameter 65537 as public exponent, and a key size of 2048 when generating the keys.

(b): Encrypt a message of you own choice using RSA, using the code you downloaded. Use the public key for encrypting your message.

(c): Decrypt the message you encrypted in the previous part. Which key do you need to use?

(d): Encrypt the file Dice.png using RSA. Does it work? If not, what is the problem?

(e): Check what is the largest number of bytes you can encrypt using RSA with the specified parameters. (Hint: it is sufficient to test with random plaintexts)

(f): Based on the above, do you think that RSA is suitable for encrypting large files? If not, suggest an alternative approach.
